# Cessen's Misc Animation Tools

This addon is just a collection of simple operators that I use in my animation worklow.  They're mainly for my person use, so I'm not putting any effort into documenting them.  But you can try to use them if you like.

They aren't accessible through menus or buttons, so you'll need to enable `Developer Extras` in `Preferences -> Interface` so that they're searchable in the F3 search menu.
